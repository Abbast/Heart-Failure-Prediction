# Heart Failure Prediction

## Background ## 
This is my second project within the Thinkful Data Science Flex Program curriculum. The focus of this project is the utilization of supervised learning methods (regression and/or classification) to build a model to predict some outcome for a chosen dataset.

## The Data ##
The data originates from: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data. The data was collected at t Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and Allied Hospital from April to December 2015.  

## Methods ##
We built and trained KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector classification models, comparing their
accuracy and false negative classifications prior to selecting one for further hyperparameter tuning with the GridSearch method.
