# ThinkfulSLta18

This is my second project within the Thinkful Data Science Flex Program curriculum. The goal of
this project is to utilize supervised learning methods (regression and/or classification) to build
a model to predict some target outcome from a previously chosen dataset.

The chosen dataset is Heart Failure Prediction dataset from Kaggle, which contains 299 rows and 14 columns. We 
built and trained KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector classification models, comparing their
accuracy and false negative classifications prior to selecting one for further hyperparameter tuning with the GridSearch
