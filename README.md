# Heart Failure Prediction

## Background ## 
This is my second project within the Thinkful Data Science Flex Program curriculum. The focus of this project is the utilization of supervised learning methods (regression and/or classification) to build a model to predict some outcome for a chosen dataset.

## The Data ##
The data originates from: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data. The data was collected at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and Allied Hospital from April to December 2015.  

## Methods ##
As the target variable is discrete (binary), we built the following classification models prior to model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine 
- Gradient Booster

We split the data into training and test sets, with the test set comprising 20 percent of the dataset prior to training and fitting, then made use of the accuracy, precision, and recall scores to compare and assess which model(s) we would proceed with. 

## Evaluation ##
Requires entry.

## Future Goals ##
- Rescale the variables for the models and reassess performance and accuracy
- Build, train, and evaluate the performance of other supervised-learning models
